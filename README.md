# Zigbee 3.0 Firmware for original LYWSD03MMC Sensor

This repository contains the Zigbee firmware for Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC Bluetooth temperature and humidity sensor.

Forked from https://github.com/devbis/z03mmc/

## my Changes

* optional switch output (to control relais or light)

* optional switch input (for light switches)

* optional switch input (for window/door contact or presense sensors)

* optional disable lcd-display (too minimize delays)

### known issues

* sometimes 1-3s delay while toggle the switch output

## comments

i have problems to flash the devices, best way for me at the moment:

* using pl2303hx usb adapter
```
# erase complete flash with one tool
python3 TLSR825xComFlasher.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 ea
# then write with an other tool
python3 ATCtelink.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 build/src/z03mmc.bin
```

some boards not working with this setup, so i can try it with FTDI-Adapter:
```
python3 ATCtelink.py --tact 1000 -d  --baud 340000 build/src/z03mmc.bin
```


## Overview

![](./assets/device.jpg)

The LYWSD03MMC is a Bluetooth temperature and humidity sensor that can be integrated into a Zigbee network using
this firmware. This repository hosts the code and related resources to flash the device and make 
it compatible with Zigbee networks.

## Features

- Firmware to convert Xiaomi LYWSD03MC device to a Zigbee compatible device with Heiman STHM-I1H model to allow zigbee2mqtt, HOMEd, and other zigbee controller use it as a known device and bind required clusters automatically.
- Flashable over SWS-UART interface using one of:

  - https://pvvx.github.io/ATC_MiThermometer/USBCOMFlashTx.html
  - https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer/blob/master/TLSR825xComFlasher.py 
  - https://github.com/pvvx/TLSRPGM 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Zigbee compatible hardware (e.g., Zigbee coordinator or gateway).
- Necessary tools for flashing firmware to the sensor.

### Building firmware

1. Clone TC32 toolchain according to your host OS:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/devbis/tc32.git -b linux
    ```
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/devbis/tc32.git -b macos
    ```
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/devbis/tc32.git -b windows
    ```

2. Clone this repository and SDK:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/devbis/z03mmc.git
    git clone https://github.com/devbis/tl_zigbee_sdk.git -b 3.6.8.5 --depth 1
   
    cd z03mmc
    ```
   
3. Configure and build:
    ```sh
    cmake -DSDK_PREFIX=$(pwd)/../tl_zigbee_sdk -DTOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=$(pwd)/../tc32 -B build .
    cmake --build build --target z03mmc.zigbee
    ```

    Firmware binary is located at `build/src/z03mmc.bin`
    The binary with OTA header is at the same folder, ending with `z03mmc.zigbee`

## Flashing firmware with USB to UART

### Prerequisites: 
1. TTL-USB adaptor
2. 1k-1.8k Ohm resistor
3. python3 with pyserial module installed


To flash a new firmware via an standard USB to UART adapter, simply connect the Thermometer as seen in the picture [Mi_SWS_Connection.jpg](./assets/Mi_SWS_Connection.jpg) to the USB to UART converter and run the TLSR825xComFlasher.py tool.

Example: `python3 TLSR825xComFlasher.py -p COM3 wf 0 z03mmc.bin`

Example: `python3 TLSR825xComFlasher.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 wf 0 z03mmc.bin`

In case if the SWS pin is used by the firmware, try this sequence:
1. Power off the sensor
2. `python3 TLSR825xComFlasher.py -p <YOUR_COM_PORT> -t5000 wf 0 z03mmc.bin`
3. Now you have 5 seconds to power on the sensor
4. In case the chip has not started being flashed, run `python3 TLSR825xComFlasher.py -p <YOUR_COM_PORT> wf 0 z03mmc.bin` without the timeout again.

If the flashing fails try to increase timeouts in the script.

The UART flasher software uses the tool from https://github.com/pvvx/ATC_MiThermometer. Thanks to pvvx for the awesome work on this!

## Related Work
z03mmc is based on the original work of @pvvx, and @atc1441, who developed the initial firmware versions for bluetooth-capable device.

- https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer

## Usage

1. Flash the firmware
2. Enable pairing mode on Zigbee coordinator
3. In case it is not joining, close the RESET and GND contacts on the board for 3 seconds to reset Zigbee settings. Replug the battery may require.
4. It introduces itself as Heiman STHM-I1H model to match the model in zigbee2mqtt and other controller software tools
